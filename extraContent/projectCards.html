            A web app to aid in understanding of asymptotic complexity
            theory, for my undergraduate honours project. This complexity
            theory tool was built with Django, Python, numPy, Heroku, &
            Bootstrap. The focus is on teaching Big-O complexity and
            Master's Theorem.

            Traveling Salesman
        </h3>
        <p class="feature-box__text">
            Detailed comparison of techniques to solve the traveling
            salesman problem, implemented with python. The non-AI technique
            used is a greedy algorithm. A Genetic algorithm and Simulated
            Annealing are the two intelligent techniques used to solve the
            NP-hard problem.

            Connect-4 AI
        </h3>
        <p class="feature-box__text">
            This is a python implementation of connect 4 using a CLI to
            setup and pygame for the GUI. My implementation for this game
            allows for the conventional game play as well as additional
            features, including an unbeatable AI using MiniMax with
            Alpha-Beta Pruning.
